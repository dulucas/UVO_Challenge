# UVO_Challenge
This is an official repo for our UVO Challenge solutions for Image-based open-world segmentation.
Code based on [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).

## Requirements
Here are the versions of libs that we used :

**Detection :**
- mmdetection == 2.16.0
- mmcv == 1.3.8
- pytorch == 1.9.0

**Segementation :**
- mmcv == 1.3.9
- mmsegmentation == 0.17.0
- pytorch == 1.9.0
